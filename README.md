Modification
============
-In order to have my css show up on the project gutenberg html files, 
I had to go into the html files and comment out the css that was 
already specified. For this, I had to comment out the <style> header. 
I then had to the point the html files towards my css file using the 
following line under the <meta> tag:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

-All css that was previously included in the html files has been 
commented out. All proceeding css in the styles.css file is my own code. 

-Code, outside help, and sources have been attributed below.
